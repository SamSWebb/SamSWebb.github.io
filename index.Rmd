This website, hosted through Github and created in RMarkdown, is a repository for all information, publications, posters, and posts related to my academic work.

On the whole, my focus is on validation of stroke specific neuropsychological assessments, and ensuring that the assessments we use are meaningful to stroke survivors and clinicians.

I am a current full-time DPhil (PhD) candidate at the [Department of Experimental Psychology](https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/) at University of Oxford, for the [Translational Neuropsychology Lab](https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/research/translational-neuropsychology). I have been awarded a fully funded Postgraduate Fellowship through [The Stroke Association](https://www.stroke.org.uk). As part of my research I attend the [Oxfordshire Stroke Rehabilitation Unit](https://www.oxfordhealth.nhs.uk/stroke-rehabilitation-unit-osru/) in Abingdon part-time. 

I completed my MSc in [Psychological Research](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-psychological-research?wssl=1) at the University of Oxford in England, and completed a BSc in [Psychology with Neuropsychology](https://www.bangor.ac.uk/courses/undergraduate/C801-Psychology-with-Neuropsychology) from Bangor University, in North Wales.
