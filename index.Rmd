This website, hosted through Github and created in RMarkdown, is a repository for all information, publications, posters, and posts related to my academic work.

On the whole, my focus is on executive dysfunction following brain injury (stroke) and how we measure dysfunction. I am particularly interested in clinical tool development, especially validation work, and neuropsychology.

I am a current full-time DPhil (PhD) candidate at the [Department of Experimental Psychology](https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/) at University of Oxford, for the [Translational Neuropsychology Lab](https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/research/translational-neuropsychology). I have been awarded a fully funded Postgraduate Fellowship through [The Stroke Association](https://www.stroke.org.uk). 

I completed my MSc in [Psychological Research](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-psychological-research?wssl=1) at the University of Oxford in England, and completed a BSc in [Psychology with Neuropsychology](https://www.bangor.ac.uk/courses/undergraduate/C801-Psychology-with-Neuropsychology) from Bangor University, in North Wales.
