### <span style="color:grey90">[Pre-Attentive Processing in Visuospatial Neglect: Burning Houses Revisited](https://osf.io/5trcx/)

-   The project seeks to replicate the pre-attentive semantic processing effect first documented by [Marshall and Halligan (1988)](https://www.nature.com/articles/336766a0) under more stringent experimental conditions, and in a broad, representative sample while investigating whether semantic or merely physical stimuli differences are responsible for modulating the occurrence of pre-attentive processing in neglect patients.

### <span style="color:grey90">[Multiverse Analysis: A Method to Determine Researcher Degrees of Freedom in Test Validation](https://osf.io/cktj9/)

-   This project builds off my MSc work at the university of Oxford and explores how we can use multiverse to highlight validation outcome fragility (whether we find significant validation comparisons or not) in validation studies using executive functioning tests
-   This project uses data from the OxMET normative project and OCS-Plus project.

### <span style="color:grey90">Ecological and predictive validity of the Oxford Digital Multiple Errands Test (OxMET) in stroke ##

The Oxford Digital Multiple Errands Test (OxMET) is a brief cognitive screen, intended as an ecologically valid approach to assessing complex executive function, in contrast to traditional abstract neuropsychological assessments with high language demands. Initial psychometric validation of the OxMET found high internal reliability and test-retest reliability, as well as good convergent and divergent validity. Here we assess aspects of predictive and ecological validity of the OxMET measures in relation to commonly used clinical function scales in a subacute stroke sample.
Participants within 3 months of confirmed stroke were recruited from a UK English-speaking specialist stroke rehabilitation in-patient setting between 2020 and 2022. Each completed the OxMET with a researcher, whilst clinical outcome measures were collected from medical notes: Barthel Index and stroke the specific Therapy Outcome Measure scale.
As of March 2022: Participants (n=333) were on average 24.94 days post stroke (SD=16.46), had a mean age of 73.8 (SD =13.05) and mean NIH Stroke Severity of 8.24 (SD= 5.32). We followed up a subset of 48 participants to complete activities of daily living and cognitive failures questionnaires to compare to baseline OxMET performance.
At baseline we found a significant but small relationship between the OxMET accuracy Barthel Index (r=.22) but we did not find a relationship between functioning and more specialist OxMET metrics such as error types. At 6-month follow we found a moderate relationship between the OxMET accuracy metric and activities of daily living (R2=.31)
The OxMET, an executive function assessment screen, was found to associate to specialist stroke relevant measures of functionality both in a rehabilitation context and community setting, but not beyond accuracy on the task. We note that the measures have a strong physical focus which may limit associations. The OxMET could be a useful and ecologically relevant tool in assessing executive function in those with limited physical or language abilities.

### <span style="color:grey90">Validation of the Oxford Cognitive Screen-Plus in UK-based English-speaking subacute and chronic stroke survivor cohorts

Stroke survivors are routinely screened for cognitive impairment with screening tools which often fail to detect subtle impairments. The Oxford Cognitive Screen â€“ Plus (OCS-Plus) is a brief computer tablet-based screening tool designed to detect more subtle impairments. We aimed to examine its psychometric properties in two stroke cohorts (subacute = <3 months post-stroke and chronic = 6 months post-stroke).
As of March 2022: 338 stroke survivors (172 subacute, 166 chronic, average age 73 (SD=13), education 13 (SD=3), sex 42.73% female presenting, ~3.42% ischaemic stroke), from two in-patient stroke units in the UK were recruited between May 2016 and March 2022, and a subset was followed up at 6-months post-stroke. All participants completed the OCS and OCS-Plus. A subset additionally completed the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and further format- and construct-matched neuropsychological tests. Due to the tablet-based format, OCS-Plus provides standardised assessment for non-specialist administration and automatic real time impairment classification against a matched normative set.
Construct validity criteria were met and exceeded the psychometric findings in the original psychometric validation using healthy control data. Incidence of cognitive impairment was higher in subacute stroke survivors compared to chronic stroke survivors, with the highest rates of impairment found for visuospatial and executive subtests. We report the sensitivity and specificity of each OCS-Plus subtest compared to neuropsychological test performance. Notably, many of those who were unimpaired on the MoCA and Oxford Cognitive Screen, demonstrated impairment on neuropsychological testing and OCS-Plus screening.
The OCS-Plus is a valid cognitive screening tool for use in stroke. OCS-Plus is able to detect subtle cognitive impairment at a similar level to selected neuropsychological assessments and exceeds detection of impairment compared to the OCS and MoCA.

### <span style="color:grey90">[The Oxford COMPetency ASSessment(COMPASS): A Brief Supplemental Cognitive Assessment Aligned with Mental Capacity Criteria](http://www.demeyerelab.org/?page_id=469)

-   This project validates a tool intended as a brief supplementary assessment of someones cognition related to the ability to make decisions as defined in [law](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/9/contents).
-   The OxMET task is within the COMPASS but has a separate paper due to the standalone ability of the OxMET to assess cognition. The tasks included in the COMPASS assess comprehension, retention, and weighing up.
- in analysis phase.

### [Essay on alternative facts in psychology](https://osf.io/5wmkr/)

-   This was an essay I wrote in 2017 for my second year of my undergraduate when I just got into Open science. I uploaded this more as a personal joke as I had no idea about open science at that point and had only just stumbled into the state of psychology (i.e., it is on fire).
