Here you can find my current (open access) projects - some are completed and some are the works, both signified.

## <span style="color:dodgerblue">Completed:

### [MSc Dissertation](https://osf.io/cktj9/)

* This forms the storage for my MSc work
* Including
    + Final anonymised data (both controls and patients data)
    + Analysis script to reproduce my analysis
    + Original pre-registration and files explaining changes along the research pipeline
  

### [Essay on alternative facts in psychology ](https://osf.io/5wmkr/)

* This was an essay I wrote in 2017 for my second year of my undergraduate when I just got into Open science. I uploaded this more as a personal joke as I had no idea about open science at that point and had only just stumbled into the state of psychology (i.e., it is on fire).



## <span style="color:dodgerblue">In progress:

### <span style="color:deeppink"> [Oxford Cognitive Screen Plus](http://www.demeyerelab.org/?page_id=434) - validation and norming

* A new tool, an updated and more domain specific addition to the [Oxford Cognitive Screen](https://www.ocs-test.org/)
* This is an upcoming paper (to be published on the AMRC framework) which provides normative scoring and validation for a new assessment of the cognitive domains: lanuage, memory, executive function, and attention. 
* As a lab we are also assessing the sensitivity and specifity of the task to MCI and dementia and preliminary results are hopeful

### <span style="color:deeppink">Oxford Digital Multiple Errands Test (OxMET) - partial validation and norming

* This is a project in preparation which establishes the normative scoring for a new version of the widely used Multiple Errands Test [(Shallice and Burgess, 1991)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/21111959_Deficits_in_strategy_application_following_frontal_lobe_damage_in_man) which is on a computer tablet. 
* This holds some reliability measures (split half, and test retest) as well as convergent and divergent validation (correlations). 
* We compare neurologically healthy controls to stroke survivors. 

### <span style="color:deeppink">The COMPetency ASSessment [(COMPASS)](http://www.demeyerelab.org/?page_id=469) - validation and norming

* This project is again about validation this time for a tool intended as a brief supplementary assessment of someones cognition related to the ability to make decisions as defined in [law](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/9/contents). 
* The paper for this will be out after the OxMET paper as the OxMET is part of the COMPASS but too big as its own task to include in the COMPASS paper.
